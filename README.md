# Description

This is a MCM Template that I used in 2015 and 2016. ``MCMthesis.sty`` is the key file. 

I divided the whole project into several tex files which can be written by different people without disturbing others. Don't be confused with so many files - the only files that's important are ``mcmpaper.tex`` and ``MCMthesis.sty``. You'd better put your figures and codes in corresponding respositories to keep the folder neat. The files will be found in their respositories.

Hope you enjoy it...
