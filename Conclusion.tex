\section{Conclusion}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In this paper, We have established a total of three mathematical models.
\item For question 1, 2. We consider the driver's profit for the purpose, so use the airport and taxi data, through the gathering

    

Class analysis, approximation, probability statistics and other methods can quantify each influencing factor and obtain a decision model.
\item For question 3, we have to consider that the setting of the boarding point should make passengers ride the most efficient. Therefore, we will get the number and interval of boarding points and how many taxis.
And how many passengers correspond to a boarding point to establish a dynamic queuing service model for time and passenger traffic
Type, the solution method uses genetic algorithm. 
The reason is different from the actual plan.
\item For question 4, we provide a priority plan: add a short-distance lane in the queuing area for the upper
The passengers in the short-distance lanes are queued for the passengers in the short-distance lanes. For the program
Validity, we conducted modeling validation.
